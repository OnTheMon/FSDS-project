\hypertarget{who-collected-the-data}{%
\subsection{1. Who collected the data?}\label{who-collected-the-data}}

\href{http://insideairbnb.com/about/}{Inside Airbnb}'s data was chiefly
collected by Murray Cox, its founder, who leverages his skills in
community activism, art, and data for social change. The project also
benefits from contributions by John Morris, a key collaborator
responsible for the website's design and major reports, and Taylor
Higgins, who focuses on data organization and community building.
Additional support comes from various past collaborators and an advisory
board, each contributing unique expertise to the analysis and
presentation of Airbnb's impact on communities.

\hypertarget{why-did-they-collect-it}{%
\subsection{2. Why did they collect it?}\label{why-did-they-collect-it}}

The data on London's Airbnb locations, types, availability and rental
prices is collected to inform data-driven public service and policy
innovation. This approach aims to address complex urban planning and
housing issues by analyzing housing market dynamics and
population-related factors to improve policy decisions.

\hypertarget{how-was-the-data-collected}{%
\subsection{3. How was the data
collected?}\label{how-was-the-data-collected}}

The data featured on the `Inside Airbnb' website was primarily collected
from the Airbnb Website itself, offering a comprehensive range of
information such as property listings, availability calendars, customer
reviews, and detailed metrics for listings in various regions and cities
globally. Additionally, the project also involves collaboration with
outside contributors who choose to participate. These collaborators,
possibly from various professional backgrounds or with specific
expertise, contribute to enhancing and expanding the data collection
process.

The collection of Airbnb data, excluding private listings, faces
limitations like time lags and lacks insights into private
communications or internal policies (Slee, n.d.). Changes in Airbnb's
website structure can impact data accuracy, and privacy concerns arise
regarding personal information. Policymakers using this data risk
introducing biases, potentially leading to ineffective or unfair
policies, and users must be aware of these constraints to avoid
incorrect inferences (Slee, n.d.).

\subsection{5. What ethical considerations does the use of this data
raise?}\label{what-ethical-considerations-does-the-use-of-this-data-raise}}

It's crucial to navigate a complex web of ethical and legal
considerations, including privacy, data ownership, and user consent.
Ethical data handling mandates not only transparency in collection,
processing, and usage but also adherence to principles like data
minimization, accuracy, non-discrimination, fairness, and accountability
(Stoyanovich, Howe \& Jagadish, 2020). Complying with legal regulations
and preventing misuse are paramount, ensuring that any data collected is
with consent, is the minimum necessary, and is used in a manner that
avoids discriminatory practices and unauthorized purposes. While
publicly accessible information may seem readily available, using it
without consent can lead to ethical dilemmas and legal challenges in
certain jurisdictions. Therefore, alongside maintaining openness about
the data's origins and modifications, securing the data against
unauthorized access is a critical responsibility, requiring robust
storage and handling measures.

通过四种类型房源的分布对比可得，Entire home apt和private
room分布范围广且在伦敦市中心（特别是商业和旅游区）非常密集；Hotel
room集中在市中心的旅游和商务区域、shared
room的分布较为分散，这两种房源的密度显著低于前两种。说明私密性、完整性好的住房更符合市场需求。

\subsubsection{6.2 Host type and number of
listings}\label{host-type-and-number-of-listings}}

通过单一房东拥有房源数量的频数直方图可知，大量的房东只拥有少数房源，可能表明这部分房东是兼职或偶尔出租自己的空置房产；另一方面，也有少数房东控制了大量房源。这些可能是专业的短期租赁公司或投资者。通过比较Airbnb在伦敦各区域房源的均价可得，高需求区域（如伦敦市中心），Airbnb的价格普遍较高，而在边远或非商业旅游热点区域，价格可能更为合理。

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsubsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

In summary, the distribution of listings: Entire home apt (completeness)
and private room (privacy) show a trend of concentration in the city
centre and hotspots, covering a wide range of areas, and adapting to the
market demand; the average price of the area: at the same time, the high
price of areas in London (especially in the city centre) with a dense
number of Airbnb listings in the convenience of tenants' diversified
needs at the same time as rewarding the landlord with a high income; the
type of landlord: a large number of landlords only have a handful of
listings, suggesting that Airbnb offers a relatively easy market for
individual hosts to enter. A small number of landlords (specialised
short-term rental companies or investors) control a large number of
listings and occupy a large share of the market, making them susceptible
to influencing the long-term rental market.
